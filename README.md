# aesutil.js

An âœ¨*opinionated*âœ¨ NodeJS convenience library for AES-256-GCM Encryption/Decryption with optional Additional Data (AAD/AEAD) in a portable way.

Meant for ciphertext storage outside the running environment, such as in a database hosted elsewhere or publicly exposed.

## Install

```bash
yarn add @f3ndot/aesutil
```

## Configuration

Set the `AESUTIL_JS_AES_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable to a cryptographically random 32 byte (256-bit) key, encoded in Base64. For example, using OpenSSL:

```bash
export AESUTIL_JS_AES_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

Save that in your env whichever way you like, for example a `.env` file if your project is setup for it:

```
AESUTIL_JS_AES_ENCRYPTION_KEY="uQDJyFHpG7qKPZgGhC/74eIWx/ItMof+T00Tho2Cam8="
```

That's all that's required to get started

### Using the `AesUtil()` class

For those who want additional configurable control, you can use `AesUtil()` instead of the two simple convenience functions described in [Usage](#usage). All parameters are optional and the defaults are shown below:

```ts
const aesUtil = new AesUtil({
  // encryption key to use as a Base64-encoded string or the raw Buffer bytes.
  // Always use to avoid needing to set the ENV VAR on your system
  providedKey: undefined,

  // the encrypted output string is not encoded in Base64 and instead returns
  // the raw bytes in a string. Handy for `BINARY` DB column or file
  // destinations
  binaryMode: false,

  // for when the supplied input string is in an encoding other than utf8 like
  // latin-1, ascii, hex, or even binary
  plaintextEncoding: "utf8",
});
```

If you just want to pass the key, the constructor supports that:

```ts
const encodedEncKey = "vLPSzkuV7rprQUGJdUGcuB+bx/rNX+a0QfZPSuiFdxY=";
const aesUtil = new AesUtil(encodedEncKey); // Can also be a Buffer containing the 32-byte unencoded key
```

## Usage

Very simple. You can use the simple functional methods, or the class for more configurability:

#### Encryption:

```ts
import { encryptValue } from "@f3ndot/aesutil";

const encryptedDataForDb = encryptValue("some sensitive plaintext");
// => 'Am4ubpry3kg3BDDK.qWgj/gOHyV9pv5U/RZ6Rzw==.WOF0+fh4hnRi7IqyUKqU15u/5nyPspvX'

storeToDb(encryptedDataForDb);
```

Or if using the class alternative:

```ts
import { AesUtil } from "@f3ndot/aesutil";

let aesUtil = new AesUtil();
let encryptedDataForDb = aesUtil.encrypt("some sensitive plaintext");
// => 'Am4ubpry3kg3BDDK.qWgj/gOHyV9pv5U/RZ6Rzw==.WOF0+fh4hnRi7IqyUKqU15u/5nyPspvX'

aesUtil = new AesUtil({ binaryMode: true });
encryptedDataForDb = aesUtil.encrypt("some sensitive plaintext");
// => '\bPR\x1F\x9BÃ¢Ã“\x99\x10/\x93,QN_\x16\x98`Â½\b\x85Ã»Ã¨a\x02Ã¬Â¼\x160[Ã–Ã¡zÂª>\x14Â¾\x88!x8\x91 \x02\x03Â«ÃšÃ¾Â Â¹XÃ³'

aesUtil = new AesUtil({ plaintextEncoding: "hex" });
encryptedDataForDb = aesUtil.encrypt("414141"); // will efficiently be stored as 3 "a" bytes (before Base64-encoding) as a result
// => 'YWFhYWFhYWFhYWFh.1b42zgCE1hBUVAQ2y1c4fg==.f7y/'
```

#### Decryption:

```ts
import { decryptValue } from "@f3ndot/aesutil";

const encryptedDataFromDb =
  "Am4ubpry3kg3BDDK.qWgj/gOHyV9pv5U/RZ6Rzw==.WOF0+fh4hnRi7IqyUKqU15u/5nyPspvX";
const plaintext = decryptValue(encryptedDataFromDb); // => 'some sensitive plaintext'
```

Or alternatively, yet again:

```ts
import { AesUtil } from "@f3ndot/aesutil";

let encryptedDataFromDb =
  "Am4ubpry3kg3BDDK.qWgj/gOHyV9pv5U/RZ6Rzw==.WOF0+fh4hnRi7IqyUKqU15u/5nyPspvX";
let aesUtil = new AesUtil(); // Can also be passed the key, Base64-encoded or not
let plaintext = aesUtil.decrypt(encryptedDataFromDb); // => 'some sensitive plaintext'

encryptedDataFromDb =
  "\bPR\x1F\x9BÃ¢Ã“\x99\x10/\x93,QN_\x16\x98`Â½\b\x85Ã»Ã¨a\x02Ã¬Â¼\x160[Ã–Ã¡zÂª>\x14Â¾\x88!x8\x91 \x02\x03Â«ÃšÃ¾Â Â¹XÃ³";
aesUtil = new AesUtil({ binaryMode: true });
plaintext = aesUtil.decrypt(encryptedDataFromDb); // => 'some sensitive plaintext'

encryptedDataFromDb = "YWFhYWFhYWFhYWFh.1b42zgCE1hBUVAQ2y1c4fg==.f7y/";
aesUtil = new AesUtil({ plaintextEncoding: "hex" });
plaintext = aesUtil.decrypt(encryptedDataFromDb); // => '414141'
```

### Associated Data / AAD / AEAD

Since AES-256-GCM is used, you can optionally supply associated data to tie to the ciphertext. This is particularly useful in a database context where a given ciphertext may belong to only one row. Associated Data would prevent ciphertext reuse.

#### Encryption:

```ts
import { encryptValue } from "@f3ndot/aesutil";

const encryptedDataForDb = encryptValue("some medical history", "user-id-1");
// => '4G4slwTqQpz3MYUf.vfgpx8urncMXtFCD+xJAKw==.fgyJEpyTr26PBknvHe3VYSeX8xM='

updateUserMedicalFile("user-id-1", encryptedDataForDb);
```

```ts
import { AesUtil } from "@f3ndot/aesutil";

const aesUtil = new AesUtil();
const encryptedDataForDb = aesUtil.encrypt("some medical history", "user-id-1");
// => '4G4slwTqQpz3MYUf.vfgpx8urncMXtFCD+xJAKw==.fgyJEpyTr26PBknvHe3VYSeX8xM='

updateUserMedicalFile("user-id-1", encryptedDataForDb);
```

#### Decryption:

```ts
import { decryptValue } from "@f3ndot/aesutil";

const encryptedDataForUser1FromDb =
  "4G4slwTqQpz3MYUf.vfgpx8urncMXtFCD+xJAKw==.fgyJEpyTr26PBknvHe3VYSeX8xM=";

const user1History = decryptValue(encryptedDataForUser1FromDb, "user-id-1"); // => 'some medical history'
const user2History = decryptValue(encryptedDataForUser1FromDb, "user-id-2"); // => Throws an error
```

```ts
import { AesUtil } from "@f3ndot/aesutil";

const encryptedDataForUser1FromDb =
  "4G4slwTqQpz3MYUf.vfgpx8urncMXtFCD+xJAKw==.fgyJEpyTr26PBknvHe3VYSeX8xM=";

const aesUtil = new AesUtil();
const user1History = aesUtil.decrypt(encryptedDataForUser1FromDb, "user-id-1"); // => 'some medical history'
const user2History = aesUtil.decrypt(encryptedDataForUser1FromDb, "user-id-2"); // => Throws an error
```

## Opinionated Decision Rationale

### Why is resulting output a string with some Base64 and dots?

Since the ciphertext, its IV, and auth tag are all encoded as Base64 strings smushed together, the resulting string is very portable and versatile. It can reasonably be copied around and transported anywhere. This can be useful in situations where binary data/non-ASCII characters would get mangled. Hex encoding could've been chosen and accomplishes the same job, but it takes up more characters.

And while SQL databases have the `BINARY` type, the additional overhead for storing the string as `TEXT` is small and consistency makes developer error less likely. Ditto for storing IV and auth tag alongside. While those could be stored in separate `BINARY` columns, it's just more work.

Ultimately there's `new AesUtil({ binaryMode: true })` now for those who want it, but the default shall remain the portable string version.

### Why AES-256-GCM?

- **AES:** A widely accepted standard algorithm that has stood the test of time and is fast
- **256-bit**: Since AES is fast enough, using its largest supported key just makes plain sense
- **Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)**: It's fast, concretely secure (as of 2023), and it adds authenticity/integrity to prevent ciphertext tampering

### Why a 12 byte (96-bit) IV length?

Because [NIST 800-38D](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf) says so.

### Why not a password-based encryption/decryption API?

Side-steps the whole debate on what best Password-Based Key Derivation function to use and keeps things fast (a property we want on symmetrically-encrypted data). Forces the implementer/developer to obtain a cryptographically random 256-bit key and use it directly versus deriving one from a less entropic password.

### Why do you want fast?

ðŸš« **This isn't for storing passwords!** _Never [encrypt your passwords!](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#hashing-vs-encryption)_ ðŸš«

Things going slowly is a desireable property for _hashing_ (commonly misnomered as _encrypting_) passwords, where the plaintext no longer needs to be known, and verifying/authenticating should be slowed to stymie brute-force attackers.

Conversely, adding an encryption layer for security at rest or transport in untrusted environments should not bog down your application/system. This library is intending to solve that problem.

However, if you intentionally want your encryption layer to be slowed down, such as when you're encrypting data with user-supplied passwords, then you can implement that outside of the library and pass the resulting key in. Example:

```ts
// Example where the library is used as part of user password-encrypted
import crypto from "crypto";
import { AesUtil } from "@f3ndot/aesutil";

// It's up to *YOU* to decide how to derive the key, with what algorithms, costs, and settings. Here's an example:
const derivedKey = crypto.scryptSync(
  "some user-supplied password",
  "some salt",
  32
);
const aesUtil = new AesUtil(derivedKey);
aesUtil.encrypt("...");
```

### Why bother using Associated Data when storing in DB rows?

Guarantees encrypted data for a particular row cannot be reused in other rows. Consider a table of users with API keys that for business reasons cannot be hashed and thus are symmetrically encrypted. Should a vulnerability occur that would allow an attacker to duplicate the encrypted API key ciphertext to other user rows, an attacker could:

1. Sign up as a User and generate an API key known to them
2. Perform the exploit to copy their API key ciphertext to the other users'
3. Gain unauthorized access to other user's information all without knowing their original API plaintext

### Why not streams?

Because I don't have a use case for large inputs/outputs yet. PR's welcome ðŸ˜Œ
